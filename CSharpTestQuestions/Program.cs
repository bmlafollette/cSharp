/*1 Declare and initialize 5 different types. Int, Boolean, String, Float, Decimal*/
/*2 Write a function that takes two of your variables above and concatenates them into a string. Print the string to the console. Be sure to call the function.*/
/*3 Create an array of strings, a simple array of names will do. Loop over the array and print it to the console.*/
/*4 Create a class called Customer class. The class should have two properties, Name and Purchase. */
/*5 Create a constructor in the class that allows you to more easily create Customer objects. The constructor should have name & purchase parameters.*/
/*6 Create a method in your Customer class that sends a thank you to the customer after their purchase.  Your console message might read something like this:
	"Hello PAUL, thank you for purchasing the FENDER JAZZ GUITAR. We hope you enjoy it. 
	NOTE: The caps are used to indicate where your variable names might go in your string.*/
/*7 Create two more methods. They should both be called SendSaleNotice. One should have no parameters and one is an overload of that same method. It should have 
	a string item as a parameter. Use these methods to announce sales. Your methods should print something similar to this message:
	Hello Paul, We wanted to let you know there's a sale coming up 4/1/2016.
	Hello Paul, We wanted to let you know there's a sale on Apple iPhones coming up on 4/1/2016.*/
/*7 Create a subclass of Customer called InactiveCutomer. The class should have an int property called MonthsInactive. */
/*8 In the InactiveCustomer subclass, create a constructor that uses the base keyword that adds a monthsInactive parameter. */
/*9 In the InactiveCustomer subclass create a method that sends a message to a customer who has been inactive for over four months. The console would read something like this:
    "Thanks for shopping with us GAVIN. We saw that you purchased an IMAC from us 5 months ago. We'd like to know if you'd like to take a look at some of our current deals."*/
/*10 You should, of course, create objects for both of these classes and test the methods on those objects.*/
/*11 Bonus: Create a PreferredCustomer class that includes a custom method made by you. */
